I'm a Postdoctoral fellow at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/). I'm interested in using cosmological observations to better understand and constrain fundamental physics, and in studying how we can get as much information as possible out of those observations. I'm also interested in science outreach and in making STEM fields more accessible and welcoming to everyone. I do research as part of the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) collaboration, where I co-led the analysis team performing a combined analysis of the survey's first three years of galaxy clustering and weak lensing data to constrain extensions to the standard cosmological model.

I grew up in Romeo, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan.  I received my undergraduate degree from Michigan State University, where I did an astrophysics undergrad thesis supervised by [Mark Voit](https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/voit/Mark.html). I spent two years at the University of Cambridge as a [Marshall Scholar](http://www.marshallscholarship.org/) where I completed [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html) and then spent a year working on modified gravity research with [Anne-Christine Davis](cam.ac.uk/people/a.c.davis/).  I got my PhD at University of Michigan's [Department of Physics](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics), where my advisor was [Dragan Huterer](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~huterer/). Before I came to Perimeter Institute, I was a Porat Fellow at [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC)](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) at Stanford. where I was part of [Risa Wechsler](https://www.risawechsler.com/)'s [galaxy formation and cosmology group](https://www.risawechsler.com/gfc-group.html).

## News and updates

* July 2023 - I was awarded the BMO Inclusive Excellence Post-Doctoral Fellowship, which recognizes a track record of fostering an inclusive environment as well as research excellence. This fellowship funds a one-year extension to my postdoc contract at Perimeter Institute.
* June 2023 - I had a great time talking about dark matter and dark energy at the [Kitchener-Waterloo Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/kitchener-waterloo-on-canada/) at The Crazy Canuck in downtown Kitchener.
* Apr. 2023 - The Dark Energy Survey Year 3 beyond-LCDM key paper, which is the product of an analysis I co-led, was [published as an editor's suggestion in Physical Review D](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.083504). That publication was highlighted in a [Perimeter Institute press release](https://insidetheperimeter.ca/putting-dark-energy-to-the-test/). 
* Nov. 2022 - The [Snowmass Cosmic Frontier report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09978) has been released. While I was not heavily involed in the development of this report, I did create an overview illustration for it at the request of the conveners.  The illustration is on the title page of the report and can also be found on [my "cartoons" page](https://www.jessiemuir.com/2022-07-27-snowmass-cosmic-frontiers/). 
* Aug. 2022 - A [NASA JPL press release](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-scientists-help-probe-dark-energy-by-testing-gravity) highlighted the [DES Year 3 galaxy clustering and weak lensing analysis of models beyond-LCDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05766) that I co-led, mentioning the plenary talk I gave on the study at the [COSMO'22 conference](https://indico.cern.ch/event/886404/) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.


### Online talks 

For the general public
* [**"Conversations at the Perimeter" podcast**](https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-cuwuz-1301c33).  As a guest on the Perimeter Insitute's podcast, I talked about dark energy and how we can learn about it using galaxy surveys like the Dark Energy Survey, as well as making science cartoons, collaborative science, and more. There's also a youtube video of the discussion [linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkozRHsbwbA&ab_channel=PerimeterInstituteforTheoreticalPhysics). 
* [**"Mapping the dark side of the Universe"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsD5oJzURN4&ab_channel=MississaugaCentreRASC) **(Public lecture, 1h15m+questions)** In March 2023 I presented at a meeting of the Mississauga Centre Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. The talk was in person with a zoom component, and this is a recording of the zoom feed.
* [**"Echoes of the Early Universe"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDKzkWo0ucQ) **(Public lecture, 1hr)** -  I gave this talk for the general public in July 2020 as part of KIPAC's online "Discover" series. It's about the  Cosmic Microwave Background, and how we can use measurements of it to learn about the history of the Universe and about fundamental physics.


Technical
* [**"Testing the standard cosmological model with the Dark Energy Survey"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeVaV2DD7xo&ab_channel=CITAPresentations) **(Seminar, 1hr)** This is a recording of my talk at the CITA seminar in early October 2022. 
* [**"DES Y3 Constraints on Beyond-ΛCDM Models with Weak Lensing & Clustering"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsf5RTo1bxc&ab_channel=CosmologyfromHome) **(Conference talk, 40m)** - This is a plenary talk that I gave with Agnès Ferté for the 2022 [Cosmology From Home](https://www.cosmologyfromhome.com/) conference. In it, we give an overview of [the DES Y3 key paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05766) reporting the analysis we co-led constraining several kinds of physics beyond the standard cosmological model. 
* [**"Towards precision cosmology on the largest observable scales"**](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR20/Session/C03.3) **(Conference talk, 30m)** - This is a talk I gave as a finalist for the APS Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin Thesis Prize  during a virtual session of the 2020 APS April meeting. It covers my dissertation projects  on [ISW signal reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06586), [CMB large-angle anomaly covariances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02354), and  [multi-probe blinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05929) for cosmology analysis.
