I'm a Postdoctoral fellow at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/). I'm interested in using cosmological observations to better understand and constrain fundamental physics, and in studying how we can get as much information as possible out of those observations. I'm also interested in science outreach and in making STEM fields more accessible and welcoming to everyone. I do research as part of the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) collaboration, where I co-lead the analysis team performing a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and weak lensing to constrain extensions to the standard cosmological model.

I grew up in Romeo, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan.  I received my undergraduate degree from Michigan State University, where I did an astrophysics undergrad thesis supervised by [Mark Voit](https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/voit/Mark.html). I spent two years at the University of Cambridge as a [Marshall Scholar](http://www.marshallscholarship.org/) where I completed [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html) and then spent a year working on modified gravity research with [Anne-Christine Davis](cam.ac.uk/people/a.c.davis/).  I got my PhD at University of Michigan's [Department of Physics](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics), where my advisor was [Dragan Huterer](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~huterer/). Before I came to Perimeter Institute, I was a Porat Fellow at [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC)](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) at Stanford. where I was part of [Risa Wechsler](https://www.risawechsler.com/)'s [galaxy formation and cosmology group](https://www.risawechsler.com/gfc-group.html).

### Online talks

For the general public
* [**"Echoes of the Early Universe"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDKzkWo0ucQ) **(Public lecture, 1hr)** -  I gave this talk for the general public in July 2020 as part of KIPAC's online "Discover" series. It's about the  Cosmic Micorwave Background, and how we can use measurements of it to learn about the history of the Universe and about fundamental physics.

Technical
* [**"DES Y3 Constraints on Beyond-ΛCDM Models with Weak Lensing & Clustering"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsf5RTo1bxc&ab_channel=CosmologyfromHome) **(Technical talk, 40m)** - This is a plenary talk that I gave with Agnès Ferté for the 2022 [Cosmology From Home](https://www.cosmologyfromhome.com/) conference. In it, we give an overview of [the DES Y3 key paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05766) reporting the analysis we co-led constraining several kinds of physics beyond the standard cosmological model. 
* [**"Towards precision cosmology on the largest observable scales"**](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR20/Session/C03.3) **(Technical talk, 30m)** - This is a talk I gave as a finalist for the APS Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin Thesis Prize  during a virtual session of the 2020 APS April meeting. It covers my dissertation projects  on [ISW signal reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06586), [CMB large-angle anomaly covariances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02354), and  [multi-probe blinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05929) for cosmology analysis.
