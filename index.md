I'm a Porat Fellow at the [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC)](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) at Stanford. I'm interested in using cosmological observations to better understand and constrain fundamental physics, and in studying how we can get as much information as possible out of those observations. I'm also interested in science outreach and in making STEM fields more accessible and welcoming to everyone.  I'm part of [Risa Wechsler](https://www.risawechsler.com/)'s [galaxy formation and cosmology group](https://www.risawechsler.com/gfc-group.html), and do research as part of the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) collaboration.

In September 2021 I'll be moving to a new position as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/).

I grew up in Romeo, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan.  I received my undergraduate degree from Michigan State University, where I did an astrophysics undergrad thesis supervised by [Mark Voit](https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/voit/Mark.html). I spent two years at the University of Cambridge as a [Marshall Scholar](http://www.marshallscholarship.org/) where I completed [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html) and then spent a year working on modified gravity research with [Anne-Christine Davis](cam.ac.uk/people/a.c.davis/).  I got my PhD at University of Michigan's [Department of Physics](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics), where my advisor was [Dragan Huterer](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~huterer/).

Want to hear me give a talk?
* [**"Echoes of the Early Universe"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDKzkWo0ucQ) **(Public lecture, 1hr)** -  I gave this talk for the general public in July 2020 as part of KIPAC's online "Discover" series. It's about the  Cosmic Micorwave Background, and how we can use measurements of it to learn about the history of the Universe and about fundamental physics.
* [**"Towards precision cosmology on the largest observable scales"**](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR20/Session/C03.3) **(Technical talk, 30m)** - This is a talk I gave as a finalist for the APS Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin Thesis Prize  during a virtual session of the 2020 APS April meeting. It covers my dissertation projects  on [ISW signal reconstruction](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1431943), [CMB large-angle anomaly covariances](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1676866), and  [multi-probe blinding](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1765119) for cosmology analysis.
