This cartoon is part of the DES Y3 [#Darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click) social media series. It was drawn to illustrate a paper, led by Juan Cordero and Ian Harrison, which describes a new approach to marginalizing over uncertainties in the line-of-sight distribution of galaxies measured by photometric survyes like DES. The paper is called, "Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Marginalisation over redshift distribution uncertainties using ranking of discrete realisations." ([arXiv:2105.1354]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.1354)).

The post's associated text was:

> Measurements of galaxy distance have uncertainty. This means our data are consistent with many possible variations of how galaxies are distributed. We use a method called Hyperrank to summarize those possibilities with just a few numbers.
