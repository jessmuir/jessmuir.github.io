This cartoon is part of the DES Y3 [#Darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click) social media series. It was drawn to illustrate a paper led by [Alex Amon](https://amonalexandra.com/about-me/), which is one of two papers describing the DES Year 3 cosmic shear measurements. In particular, this paper focuses on the measurements that go into the analysis and the robustness of the cosmological results to observational uncertainties and systematics.   The paper's title is, "Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Cosmology from Cosmic Shear and Robustness to Data Calibration" ([arXiv:2105.13543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13543)).

> Going from telescope images to catalogs of galaxy shapes and colors, to weak lensing measurements, to cosmology results is a complicated process. Along the way we do lots of tests to make sure our results are robust to uncertainties from each step of that analysis.
>
> This paper presents results from cosmic shear analyses and details their robustness to observational uncertainties like redshift estimation and the blending of light from overlapping galaxies.
