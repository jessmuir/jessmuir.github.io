This cartoon is part of the DES Y3 [#Darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click) social media series. It was drawn to illustrate a paper led by Martin Rodriguez-Monroy, which describes DES Year 3 galaxy clustering measurements and the technique used to correct them for observational systematics.  The paper's title is, "Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Galaxy clustering and systematics treatment for lens galaxy samples" ([arXiv:2105.13540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13540)).

The post's associated text was:

> The way galaxies cluster together tells us about how structures in the Universe form and evolve, but to see them we have to look through Earthâ€™s atmosphere and the stars in our own galaxy. We have to correct for contaminations before we can learn about distant galaxies.

[Here's a link to the post.](https://twitter.com/theDESurvey/status/1405197552664854532) The twitter thread of the Y3 Darkbites posts [begins here](https://twitter.com/theDESurvey/status/1334937310606004227). The cartoons also being shared on the DES [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/darkenergysurvey) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/darkenergysurvey/) pages.


Here's a non-animated version of the illustration:
