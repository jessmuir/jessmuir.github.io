![alt="Cartoon of someone using photos of parts of an animal to inform a model for what that animal is. Initially that model is a duck, but new data (a tail photo) shows that it is a platypus."](/cartoons/images/External_Tensions_labels_english.jpg)

This cartoon is part of the DES Y3 [#Darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click) social media series. It was drawn to illustrate a paper about the method used to check for tension between cosmological constraints made with different datasets. The paper was led by Pablo Lemos and Marco Raveri and is titled, "Assessing tension metrics with Dark Energy Survey and Planck data." ([arXiv:2012.09554](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09554))

> Different measurements of the large-scale Universe give us pieces of a big picture describing its properties. If DES results don’t match what we expect from other observations, we might have discovered something new!  


[Here's a link to the post.](https://twitter.com/theDESurvey/status/1351574345794117636) The twitter thread of the Y3 Darkbites posts [begins here](https://twitter.com/theDESurvey/status/1334937310606004227). The cartoons also being shared on the DES [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/darkenergysurvey) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/darkenergysurvey/) pages.

I've also made a version of this cartoon with the labels in Spanish:
