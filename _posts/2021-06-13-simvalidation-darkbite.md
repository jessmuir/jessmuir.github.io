This cartoon is part of the DES Y3 [#Darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click) social media series. It was drawn to illustrate a paper led by Joe DeRose, which describes simulations and simulated analyses used to validate the DES Y3 galaxy clustering and weak lensing analysis.   The paper's title is, "Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: cosmology from combined galaxy clustering and lensing -- validation on cosmological simulations" ([arXiv:2105.13547](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13547)).

The post's associated text was:

> Airplane pilots use flight simulators to train because it lets them plan routes and test techniques without the risks of flying a real plane. Similarly, before using real measurements to infer the properties of the Universe, we analyze simulated DES data. 
>
>These simulated analyses let us test-drive our calculations and code: we know what went into making the simulation, so we can check that we recover the right answer!
